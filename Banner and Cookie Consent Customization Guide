# Banner and Cookie Consent Customization Guide

**Description:**  
This guide explains how to customize a website banner for cookie consent. It covers settings for display delay, logo, dark mode, consent actions, query parameter storage, and customizable text. You can adjust these options to tailor the user experience.

---

### Banner Display Delay

The `bannerShowingDelayed` variable controls the delay time (in milliseconds) before the banner appears.

1. **Set Delay Time:** Set a delay in milliseconds. For example, to set a 3-second delay:

   ```javascript
   var bannerShowingDelayed = 3000; // Banner appears after 3 seconds
   ```

2. **Show Banner Immediately:** Set to `0` for no delay:

   ```javascript
   var bannerShowingDelayed = 0; // No delay, shows right away
   ```

---

### Logo Customization

You can add, remove, or resize the logo on the banner.

1. **Add a Logo:** Set `websiteLogo` to the URL of the logo:

   ```javascript
   var websiteLogo = "https://example.com/logo.svg";
   ```

2. **Remove the Logo:** Set `websiteLogo` to an empty string to hide the logo:

   ```javascript
   var websiteLogo = "";
   ```

3. **Set Logo Size:** Adjust `logoWidth` to set the logo’s size in pixels:

   ```javascript
   var logoWidth = "80px"; // Logo width set to 80 pixels
   ```

---

### Dark Mode Customization

You can enable dark mode, set a default mode, and let users toggle between light and dark modes.

1. **Enable Dark Mode:** Set `darkModeEnable` to `true` to make dark mode available:

   ```javascript
   var darkModeEnable = true;
   ```

2. **Set Default Mode:** Use `darkModeDefault` to set the default mode to either "light" or "dark." This example checks if a previous mode is saved in `localStorage`. If not, it defaults to "light":

   ```javascript
   var darkModeDefault = localStorage.getItem("viewMode") ? localStorage.getItem("viewMode") : "light";
   ```

3. **Show Toggle for Light/Dark Mode:** Set `showIconOfModes` to `true` to show a toggle icon for users to switch between modes:

   ```javascript
   var showIconOfModes = true;
   ```

### Default Consent and Main Banner Consent Actions

These settings manage the default consent and actions for Accept, Customize, or Decline on the banner.

1. **Default Consent Setting:** Set `defaultConsent` to `true` if you want consent to be granted by default, or `false` if not:

   ```javascript
   var defaultConsent = false; // Default is consent denied
   ```

2. **Accept Button Action:** Use `onClickAccept` to define the action for clicking "Accept":

   ```javascript
   var onClickAccept = "granted"; // Consent granted on Accept
   ```

3. **Customize Button Action:** Use `onClickCustom` to specify the outcome of clicking "Customize." Options include:
   - `"granted"`: All options are accepted.
   - `"denied"`: All options are denied.
   - `"normal"`: Lets users choose specific options.

   ```javascript
   var onClickCustom = "normal";
   ```

4. **Decline Button Action:** Use `onClickDeclined` to set what happens on clicking "Decline":

   ```javascript
   var onClickDeclined = "denied"; // Consent denied on Decline
   ```

---

### Second Banner and Consent Reminder Settings

The second banner is a follow-up if users decline consent on the first banner. You can control when it shows and the actions if they accept or decline again.

1. **Enable Second Banner:** Set `secondBannerEnable` to `true` to display the second banner:

   ```javascript
   var secondBannerEnable = true;
   ```

2. **Accept Button Action on Second Banner:** Use `onClickAcceptSecond` to define what happens if users click "Accept" on the second banner:

   ```javascript
   var onClickAcceptSecond = "granted"; // Consent granted on Accept
   ```

3. **Decline Button Action on Second Banner:** Use `onClickDeclinedSecond` to set the action for clicking "Decline" on the second banner:

   ```javascript
   var onClickDeclinedSecond = "denied"; // Consent denied on Decline
   ```

4. **Second Banner Delay:** Set `secondBannerShowingTime` to control the delay (in seconds) before the second banner appears:

   ```javascript
   var secondBannerShowingTime = 10; // Shows after 10 seconds
   ```

---

### Query Parameter Storage

These settings control which URL query parameters are stored and how they’re handled in the URL.

1. **Store Query Parameters:** Set `storeQuery` to `true` to save specific query parameters in `localStorage`.

   ```javascript
   var storeQuery = true;
   ```

2. **Add Parameters Back to URL:** Set `addBackToUrl` to `true` if you want stored query parameters added back to the URL as users navigate.

   ```javascript
   var addBackToUrl = true;
   ```

3. **Specify Query Parameters to Store:** Define which parameters to save by listing them in `queryParamsToStore`. Only parameters listed here will be saved.

   ```javascript
   var queryParamsToStore = ['gcild', 'utm_source', 'utm_medium'];
   ```

> **Image:** Add a screenshot here to show an example of stored query parameters in `localStorage`.
